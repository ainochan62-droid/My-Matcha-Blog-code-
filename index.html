    <h3>Matcha</h3>
    <p id="text"> First of all, I want to explain the difference between matcha and green tea because people often
        confuse matcha with green tea. However, this is understandable because matcha and green tea actually have many
        similarities, for instance their taste, color, and scent.<br><br><i>Matcha</i> is one of the
        kinds
        of green tea and has a stronger caffeine content and aroma than regular green tea. The tea leaves are finely
        ground before brewing. Moreover, the entire tea leaf is consumed, which is different from drinking green
        tea.<br><br><i>Green tea</i> must be strained before consumption and has a milder flavor and aroma. Its caffeine
        content is not as strong as matcha's.
